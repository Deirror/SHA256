This repository contains
-

-  An introduction to SHA256
-  A simple and cleanly written implementation of the algorithm in C++
-  Some additional websites, which really helped me understand how the algorithm works

What is it about?
-

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and part of the SHA-2 family. It is widely used for securing data through digital signatures, certificates, and password hashing.

The algorithm is secure and widely used in applications like blockchain technology (e.g., Bitcoin), data integrity verification, and secure authentication mechanisms.

Description of the project
-

-  When you run main.cpp, a "result.txt" must be generated for you which contains the hashed input. It's highly unlikely that two different inputs will produce the same hash
