What is it about?
-

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and part of the SHA-2 family. It is widely used for securing data through digital signatures, certificates, and password hashing.

The algorith is secure and widely used in applications like blockchain technology (e.g., Bitcoin), data integrity verification, and secure authentication mechanisms.

This repository contains:
-

-  A simple and cleanly written implementation of the algorithm in C++.
-  An introduction to SHA256.
